\section{INTRODUCTION}

This article serves as a means of documenting the progress made by the IREC Avionics team in the development of a state-space model describing the dynamcis of a sounding rocket that is to compete in the Spaceport America Cup (formerly IREC) rocketry competition. The article is the culmination of the team's understanding in state-space control methods at the time of writing. We have limited expertise in the subject matter as we are a student team, therefore, care should be taken when referencing any material from this article.
