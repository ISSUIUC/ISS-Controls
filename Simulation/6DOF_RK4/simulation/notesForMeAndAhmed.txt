From end to finish on how alpha is used
a) in pysim.py, alpha is defined in Class Simulation: def execute_stage
    the code is self.x, alpha = sim.RK4(self.x, dt, self.time_stamp, is_staging, 0)
b) looking at simulator.py, in def RK4, the alpha is calculated in line 92
    the code is temp,alpha = (self.rocket.forces.get_force(np.array([p, v, y0[3], y0[4]]), flap_ext, time_stamp, ejection_force, ejection_theta, ejection_phi, density_noise=density_noise))
c) then in forces.py, in function def get_force, alpha is calculated in get_alpha in line 81
    the code is alpha = self.get_alpha(x_state, wind_vector)


to utilize a multiplier parameter, we need to modify in this order
1) forces.py : def get_alpha
2) forces.py : def get_forces
3) simulator.py : def RK4
